## Project Title: Pivot Table Insights

### Project Overview
The Pivot Table Insights project focuses on utilizing pivot tables to analyze and visualize data effectively. This project demonstrates how to transform raw data into actionable insights through interactive pivot tables, making it easier for users to summarize, explore, and understand complex datasets.

### Objectives
- To demonstrate the effectiveness of pivot tables in data analysis.
- To provide a user-friendly interface for generating pivot tables from various data sources.
- To enhance data exploration through dynamic filtering, sorting, and aggregation.

### Data Sources
- Data Import: Users can import datasets from multiple formats, including CSV, Excel, and Google Sheets.
- Interactive Pivot Table Creation: Users can drag and drop fields to create custom pivot tables in real-time.
- Aggregation Functions: Support for various aggregation functions such as sum, average, count, min, and max.
- Dynamic Filtering: Users can apply filters to focus on specific data subsets.
- Visualizations: Generate charts and graphs based on pivot table results for enhanced data visualization.
- Export Options: Save the pivot table and visualizations as PDF, CSV, or image formats.

### TooLS Used

- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](../../Documents/Copy%20of%20Pivot_Tables_File(1).xlsx)
  1. For Data Cleaning,
  2. For Analysis
  3. For Data Visualization

- SQL- Structured Query Language for Querying of Data
- GitHub for Porfolio Building

### Data Cleaning and Preparetions

In the initial phase of the Data Cleaning and Preparations, we perform the following action;
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Handling Missing Variables
3. Data Cleaning and Formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

  EDA involves the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the Data 
  such as:
- Region By Revenue
- Revenue By Unit Sold
- Products By Unit Sold
- Top Five (5) Market By Revenue
- Bottom Five (5) Stores By Unit Sold

### Data Analysis
 
  This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during your analysis;
Create pivot table on an existing worksheet: Alt+F1.
 
 ```SQL

 * FROM TABLE 1
  WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
  ```
